# Project_software

An introduction to the project: 



This project falls within the requirements of the software engineering course. In this project, we, as a team consisting of 3 members, search for an idea for a project that aims to create a mobile application that provides services and meets the needs of the users. After a period of searching for an idea, we came up with For Work, a mobile application project that is used to contribute to solving the problem of unemployment and serves users from the categories of job seekers and companies that need employees. This type of project falls under the fields of business and communication between others. Our goals for this project are to provide a quick search and communication service between employees and companies through "online interviews or messages." Also, one of our goals is to provide all the steps required to find the fastest and best-suited job in the shortest possible time and in one app!.




Currently, we, as a team, are required to implement this project. to implement this project in phases. First, design the UI using the Figma platform. Then we work on converting this UI into an application. In this project, we use Flutter to work on the front-end part. And then programming the backend using Firebase. Therefore, we created a new repository for this project on Github to follow up on the project, upload or update the required files, and complete it as expected. Also, we are currently in the stage of converting the UI to Flutter code, and in the next stage, we are trying to integrate the frontend with the backend using Firebase. Then work on programming the functions and the rest of the requirements.



The list of features:



1-The first feature of our application is that it allows access to the location to display quick results according to the proximity of the company or employee.(27-4-2024)



2-On the search page, there is a filter to choose the type of work and its hours to shorten the search results.(30-4-2024)



3-There are also interviews between employees and companies, either by video call or messages through the application.(3-5-2024)



4-Receive notifications to the employee or company as a reminder at the time of the interview.(7-5-2024)



5-The last feature is that when an employee applies to more than one company, the status of his acceptance to the job is clarified (his CV has been read or reviewed, or he has been rejected).(12-5-2024)



The problems we are facing:




1- After switching from Figma to Flutter, we can see changes to the page, such as changes to the text and colour of the "UI design." (Saturday, April 20)




2- The site we used to convert figma to flutter is limited. It does not contain more than 30 pages, and we need 45 pages. (Saturday, April 20)




3- We also face a problem with how to use the vs. code program and how to display screens sequentially, as it was in the UI design.
